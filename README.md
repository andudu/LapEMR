INTRODUCTION
====

LapEMR is a package for semi-supervised learning. The package includes the MATLAB interface of the algorithm LapESVR.  


USAGE 
====

The package was developed with MATLAB and C++. The QP solver is adapted from LIBSVM which is implemented by C++ with matlab interface and other parts are implemented by Matlab. To run test the code, please execuate 'demo' in the Matlab prompt
````matlab
